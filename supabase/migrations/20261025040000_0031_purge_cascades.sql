-- =====================================================================
-- 0031 — what a purge or a branch removal takes along with it, for the tables of 0028 and 0030.
-- This migration removes rows, so the owner pastes it in the Supabase SQL editor (as with 0022); it is never sent
-- through the assistant's database tool. Apply it together with 0022, after 0030.
--   1. A stay's nights go with the stay when a purge removes the stay (reservation_nights → reservations).
--   2. A branch removed while unused takes its automatic cash box and bank account with it (cash_accounts →
--      branches). A branch with any voucher, settlement or payout is never removable (fn_definition_dependencies).
--   3. Purging «المالية» also removes the period's card-terminal settlements, and the platform payouts left with no
--      payment; a payout that still has a payment stays.
